The traditional KYC process involves repeated verification of the same user data by multiple institutions, leading to inefficiencies, high costs, and security risks. Centralized systems storing sensitive user information, such as Aadhaar details, are vulnerable to breaches and unauthorized access. This project solves these issues by creating a decentralized platform where: Aadhaar verification happens once and is securely stored on a blockchain. Verified data can be accessed by authorized institutions without revealing sensitive user information. 
This project develops a blockchain-based KYC (Know Your Customer) verification system to streamline the verification process while enhancing security and privacy. Know your customer (KYC) checks are currently an extremely time consuming and costly affair. Banks have to spend millions of dollars every year to keep up with KYC regulations or risk being fined heavily. Through KYC chain we aim to simplify this process to a great extent. 
KYC-chain eliminates the redundant KYC checks that banks currently perform by maintaining a common secure database in a block-chain. The nature of a block-chain ensures that unauthorized changes to the data are automatically invalidated. The proof-of-reputation concept makes the verification process more robust.
 The platform enables users to verify their Aadhaar details once and securely share the verification status with multiple institutions without repeatedly providing sensitive data. By integrating blockchain, the project eliminates the risks of data tampering and unauthorized access, giving users full control over their information. .
 The project aims to develop a secure, transparent, and decentralized platform for Aadhaar-based KYC (Know Your Customer) verification using blockchain technology. The system seeks to address issues of redundancy, data breaches, and inefficiency associated with traditional KYC processes. By integrating blockchain with web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), the platform offers a seamless user interface and an immutable backend system to enhance trust and efficiency in KYC verification.
